# MathPreper Project

Goal for this project is to create a website to help students prepare for math exams. In this website, students would be able to log in to their account. In their account, they would be able to save any math problem they encounter, the answer to that problem, and the process of how they got the answer. By doing so, the website can generate a multitude of similar problems to that question with their own different answers. These similar questions can be different inputs and/or different wording than the original question. After saving a few questions, the student can choose how many similar questions to each of those questions to do. This will allow the student to create effective sample practice tests and quizzes.
